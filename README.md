# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It provides a simple and powerful setup for starting React applications with a minimal configuration.

## Project Setup

This project was initialized using Create React App, which is a widely used tool for setting up React applications with zero configuration. You can learn more about Create React App in the official GitHub repository: [Create React App GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following npm commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

- The page will automatically reload when you make edits.
- Any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
You can run tests and see the results in real-time.  
For more details, refer to the [React testing documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing.html).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  
The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes for cache-busting.  
Your app is now ready to be deployed!

For more information about deployment, refer to the [Create React App Deployment Guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

If youâ€™re looking to customize the build configuration beyond the default setup, you can eject the project. This will expose all configuration files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) in the project directory.

While this gives you complete control over the build process, it also means youâ€™ll have to maintain and configure the setup yourself.

For more information, see the [ejecting documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/available-scripts#npm-run-eject).

## Learn More

You can learn more about React and Create React App in the following resources:

- [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started)  
  Provides in-depth information on how to work with Create React App.

- [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/)  
  Official documentation for learning React concepts and building React applications.

## Code Splitting

Code splitting is an optimization technique that allows you to split your JavaScript bundle into smaller files, which can then be loaded on demand. This can help improve the performance of your application by reducing initial load time.

To learn more about code splitting, refer to the official documentation:  
[Code Splitting in React](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/code-splitting).

## Analyzing the Bundle Size

Itâ€™s important to keep track of the size of your appâ€™s JavaScript bundle to optimize performance. The `npm run build` command will generate a production build, but if you want to analyze the size of your app's final bundle, you can use the `source-map-explorer` tool.

Learn more about analyzing your bundle size here:  
[Analyzing the Bundle Size](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size).

## Making a Progressive Web App (PWA)

Create React App comes with support for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). By following the official guide, you can turn your app into a PWA, which enables offline functionality and better performance.

Learn how to make your app a PWA here:  
[Making a Progressive Web App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app).

## Advanced Configuration

If you need more control over the build configuration (such as Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.), you can customize your setup using the `eject` command. However, after ejecting, you will be responsible for managing and maintaining your own build tools.

For more advanced configuration options, visit the official guide:  
[Advanced Configuration](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration).

## Deployment

When youâ€™re ready to deploy your React app, the `npm run build` command will prepare a production-ready version of the application. There are various ways to deploy the app to different platforms (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, AWS, etc.).

For more detailed deployment instructions, refer to the official guide:  
[Deployment Guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the build process, such as `npm run build` failing to minify your app, consult the troubleshooting guide for solutions to common problems.

Check out the troubleshooting section here:  
[Troubleshooting Guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify).
